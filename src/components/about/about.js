                <p>My first introduction into coding was a moment of pure serendipity. I was starting my second year of college and took "Introduction to Python" on a whim. I loved every minute of the class, but the only follow up wouldn't come until my senior year.</p>
                <p>I tried to go to Kenessaw State to take more coding classes, but I felt like I was getting nowhere. </p>
