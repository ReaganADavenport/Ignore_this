                <p>Hi! My name is Reagan Davenport.</p>
                <p>I'm a full-stack developer. I build, and occasionally design, beautiful, responsive, and functional websites to facilitate e-commerce.</p>
                <p>I prefer to work in a full-cycle, from mock-ups to HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
                <p>I've only been working in the field for a year, but I'm always on the hunt for new things to learn.</p>
